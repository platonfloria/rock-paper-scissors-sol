Create an upgradeable EVM based smart contract for the purpose to play Rock, Paper and Scissors. The game will be played between two players.

The game starts once each player has deposited an amount of an ERC20 token into the contract. The deployer of the contract sets which ERC20 token to use. 

The winner will receive the total amount of ERC20 token that was deposited into the contract. If there is a tie the ERC20 amount in the contract should be divided by both players.
